# Mock Shopping Cart

## Summary
This project is part of the Odin Project curriculum. The goal is to create a fake website for an online shop. Products' information are retrieved from <a href="https://fakestoreapi.com/">FakeStoreAPI</a>

## Features: 
- Product Listing: Displays a list of products retrieved from an API.
- Product Details: Allows users to view detailed information about each product.
- Shopping Cart: Users can add products to the cart, adjust quantities, and remove items.
- Persistent Cart State: The shopping cart state is stored in localStorage, so it  persists across page reloads.
- Routing: navigation between different pages (e.g., homepage, shop, product details, cart) using React Router.

## Outcome learned: 

- Dynamic routing: Use createBrowserRouter in main.jsx to handle dynamic routing.

- Nested routes: Routes are nested inside App.jsx to avoid re-rendering of Header and Footer.

- Styling with CSS module.

- Fetching data from an API using a Provider component.
